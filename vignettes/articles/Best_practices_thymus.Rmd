## Motivation to develop this vignette.

Correcting batch effects is an important step in every multi-batch scRNA-seq data analysis of *biological replicates*, where we would like to preserve the within-differences of batches while reducing technical differences. We acknowledge that batch effects correction is just a single step in a complete analysis, and we wouldn't like to spend so much time on it. However, we think that it is important to pay special attention to correct batch effects because *an incorrect analysis could completely change the conclusions* of downstream analyses and we might end up *wasting a significant amount of research-time*.

After experiencing diverse problems and difficulties correcting batch effects, we decided to make this vignette to help you to perform this task as smoothly as possible. Our tips to share with you are the next:

* **Tip 1**. Double-check the labels you use to correct batch effects. 
* **Tip 2**. Always confirm the assay used on each step
* **Tip 3**. Pay special attention to the variable features used to correct batch effects.
* **Tip 4**. Confirm that you are using the correct variable features
* **Tip 5**. Confirm the number of PCs after correcting batch effects

In this vignette, we will explain further these tips with a guided batch correction example using two *thymus* data sets from [Tabula Muris](https://tabula-muris.ds.czbiohub.org/#:~:text=Tabula%20Muris%20is%20a%20compendium,from%2020%20organs%20and%20tissues.):

## Load seurat objects

Let's load the two data sets using their URLs. Alternatively, you can first download the data sets and load them from your *Downloads* folder.

```{r}
thymus_ls <- list()

# Load the droplets data set
#load(here("~/Downloads/droplet_Thymus_seurat_tiss.Robj"))
load(url("https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/13090580"))
thymus_ls[["droplets"]] <- tiss

# Load the facs data set
#load(here("~/Downloads/facs_Thymus_seurat_tiss.Robj"))
load(url("https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/13092398"))
thymus_ls[["facs"]] <- tiss
rm(tiss)
```

The data sets downloaded from Tabula Muris are Seurat objects, but they are in an old format. Then, we need to update them using the `UpdateSeuratObject` function.

```{r, message=FALSE}
thymus_ls <- lapply(X = thymus_ls, FUN = Seurat::UpdateSeuratObject)
```

## Tip 1. Double-check the label you will use to correct batch effects. 

All batch effect correction methods require a batch `label` to distinguish data sets. In this case, because the data sets were prepared using different technologies (droplets and facs), we would like to correct the technical differences related to *technology*. If your data sets were prepared with the same technology but sequenced in different samples, you might like to correct the differences related to *samples*. It would be the same for *biological* or *technical* replicates, you might like to correct technical differences using the *replicate* label.

As we said before, in this example we would like to reduce the technical differences between the technologies used to prepare the cells. Because we don't have a common label related to the technology, let's create one for each data set.

```{r}
thymus_ls$droplets[["tech"]] <- "droplets"
thymus_ls$facs[["tech"]] <- "facs"
```

## Tip 2. Always confirm the assay used on each step

In a typical batch effect correction workflow we would be switching between `assays` on different steps, e.g. `RNA`, `integrated` or `Canek`, etc. Then, we would recommend you to explicitly write the assay used on each step, so you are sure of using the correct one.

On this vignette, we follow the *standard preprocessing* workflow from [Seurat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Seurat/index.html) R package (see *Seurat-Guided Clustering Tutorial* [vignette](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html)) to normalize the `RNA` assay of the batches. 

```{r}
thymus_ls <- lapply(X = thymus_ls, FUN = Seurat::NormalizeData, assay = "RNA", verbose = FALSE)
```

## Tip 3. Pay special attention to the variable features used to correct batch effects.

One important step for batch correction is the selection of *highly variable genes*, also known as *variable features* (VF), that properly capture the heterogeneity of batches without *over-fitting* or adding *noisy* signals. The simplest way to do this is to obtain *independent* VFs for each batch and then find their *intersection*. In this way, the number of independent VFs serves as a *trade-off* between reducing or preserving the within-batch differences. Let's check this trade-off using UMAP representations of the `uncorrected` data with an increasing number of VF (1k, 5k, and 10k independent VFs).  

```{r}
#set the number of VFs to use
n_VF <-  c(1000, 5000, 10000)
#get the uncorrected data
uncorrected <- Reduce(f = merge, x = thymus_ls)
#normalize the uncorrected data
uncorrected <- NormalizeData(object = uncorrected, assay = "RNA")
#list to store the plots using different number of VFs
plots_ls <- list()
#for each number of VFs
for(n in n_VF){
  # Get the intersection of VF using the GetIntersectHVF. This functions returns a vector containing the names of the VFs.
  intersected_VFs <- GetIntersectHVF(object_ls = thymus_ls, n_features = n)
  #set the variable features
  VariableFeatures(uncorrected) <- intersected_VFs
  # Scale the uncorrected data for PCA. Make sure to use the VFs found before.
  uncorrected <- ScaleData(object = uncorrected, features = intersected_VFs, assay = "RNA", verbose = FALSE)
  # Get PCA and UMAP dimensionality reductions. Make sure to use the VFs found before. 
  #For now let's use the first 15 PCs. This is just a common number of PCs used in scRNA-seq analyses, but feel free to use a different number.
  uncorrected <- RunPCA(object = uncorrected, assay = "RNA", features = intersected_VFs, npcs = 15, verbose = FALSE)
  uncorrected <- RunUMAP(object = uncorrected, dims = 1:15, reduction = "pca", verbose = FALSE)
  # Save the scatterplot 
  plots_ls[[as.character(n)]] <- DimPlot(object = uncorrected, group.by = "tech", pt.size = 0.1 ) +
    ggtitle(label = "", subtitle = paste0("Independent HVG: ", n, "\nIntersected HVG: ",
                                          length(intersected_VFs))) 
}
rm(intersected_VFs, n_VF, n)
```

Let's check the UMAP plots using different sets of VFs.

```{r}
plots_ls[[1]] + plots_ls[[2]] + plots_ls[[3]] + plot_layout(guides = "collect") & NoAxes() + myTheme + theme(legend.position = "bottom", )
```

As you can observe,

* If we used a small number of VFs (left plot; VFs before intersection: 1k, VFs after intersection: 206), we get subtle differences between the data sets, but the structures of cells are not well defined.
* If we use a large number of VFs (right plot; VFs before intersection: 10k, VFs after intersection: 4992), we capture a more complex structure of the cells, but the differences between batches increased significantly.

Therefore, we would prefer to use a midpoint set of VFs that captures the heterogeneity of cells without over-increasing the batch differences, e.g. the UMAP in the center.

To ease the selection of *integration VFs*, we provide the function `FindIntegrationHVF` to find and average the number of intersected VFs within a given range. Let's use this function to find 1500 (+/- 100) intersected VFs.  

```{r}
integration_features <- FindIntegrationHVF(object_ls = thymus_ls, n_features = 1500, range = 100)
```

Let's visualize the *uncorrected* data using the variable features we just found. 

```{r}
VariableFeatures(uncorrected) <- integration_features
uncorrected <- ScaleData(object = uncorrected, assay = "RNA", features = integration_features,verbose = FALSE)
uncorrected <- RunPCA(object = uncorrected, assay = "RNA", features = integration_features, npcs = 50, verbose = FALSE)
```

Let's check out the elbow plot of the PCs.

```{r}
MyElbowPlot(seurat_object = uncorrected, n_components = 30)
```

The variance stabilizes after 7 PCs. In this test, we will use 10 PCs to calculate the UMAP visualization, but feel free to try other numbers.

```{r}
set.seed(777)
uncorrected <- RunUMAP(object = uncorrected, dims = 1:10, reduction = "pca", verbose = FALSE)
```

Let's visualize the uncorrected data by *technology* and *cell-type*. 
NOTE: Tabula Muris provide the annotated cell types in the label `cell_ontology_class`.

```{r}
DimPlot(object = uncorrected, group.by = "tech", pt.size = 0.1) +
  DimPlot(object = uncorrected, group.by = "cell_ontology_class", pt.size = 0.1) &
  NoAxes() + myTheme
```

We can observe that the technical differences between technologies caused the *immature T cells* to cluster by technology. We would like to correct these differences using `Canek`.

## Tip 4. Confirm that you are using the correct variable features.

To correct batch effects, Canek accepts either a list of objects or single objects with a `batch` identifier. Don't forget to pass the set of VFs we previously found.

```{r}
#RunCanek in a list of SingleCellExperiment objects
#corrected <- Canek::RunCanek(x = sce, features = integration_features)
#RunCanek in a single object with a batch identifier
corrected <- Canek::RunCanek(x = uncorrected, batches = "tech", features = integration_features)
```

To perform PCA it's important to use the `corrected log counts`. These are saved in the assay `Canek` in the `SingleCellExperiment` object and can be specified by changing the `exprs_values` parameter.

```{r}
corrected <- ScaleData(object = corrected, features = integration_features, assay = "Canek", verbose = FALSE)
corrected <- RunPCA(object = corrected, assay = "Canek", features = integration_features, npcs = 50, verbose = FALSE)
```

## Tip 5. Confirm the number of PCs after correcting batch effects.

Let's check out the elbow plot after correction. 

```{r}
MyElbowPlot(seurat_object = corrected, n_components = 30)
```

After correction, the elbow plot presents small changes as compared with the one we found using the `uncorrected` data set. Then, we will continue using 10 PCs (feel free to try other numbers).

```{r}
set.seed(777)
corrected <- RunUMAP(object = corrected, dims = 1:10, reduction = "pca", verbose = FALSE)
```

Finally, we can now visualize the `corrected` data by `tech` and `cell_ontology_class` (cell type) labels. We can observe that after batch correction with Canek, we minimize the batch difference in *immature T cells*.

```{r}
DimPlot(object = corrected, group.by = "tech", pt.size = 0.1) +
  DimPlot(object = corrected, group.by = "cell_ontology_class", pt.size = 0.1) &
  NoAxes() + myTheme
```
