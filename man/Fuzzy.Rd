Fuzzy(
  cluMem = NULL,
  pcaQue = NULL,
  corCell = NULL,
  fuzzyPCA = 10,
  MST = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cluMem}{Memberships' clustering data.}

\item{pcaQue}{PCA representation of the cells.}

\item{corCell}{Matrix containing the initial membership assignment.
Matrix dimensions are expected as #Cell x #Memberships, with each row sum equal to 1.}

\item{fuzzyPCA}{Number of PCs to use in the fuzzy process.}

\item{MST}{Minimum spanning tree}

\item{verbose}{Print output.}
}
\description{
Function to score cell's memberships by fuzzy logic
}
\details{
This function perform the fuzzification for the cells' membership.
 A minimum spanning tree (MST) is created among memberships, and the fuzzification is performed
  for each of the edges of the MST.#'
